abstract = {Chern insulators are band insulators exhibiting a nonzero Hall conductance but preserving the lattice translational symmetry. We conclusively show that a partially filled Chern insulator at 1/3 filling exhibits a fractional quantum Hall effect and rule out charge-density wave states that have not been ruled out by previous studies. By diagonalizing the Hubbard interaction in the flat-band limit of these insulators, we show the following: The system is incompressible and has a 3-fold degenerate ground state whose momenta can be computed by postulating an generalized Pauli principle with no more than 1 particle in 3 consecutive orbitals. The ground state density is constant, and equal to 1/3 in momentum space. Excitations of the system are fractional statistics particles whose total counting matches that of quasiholes in the Laughlin state based on the same generalized Pauli principle. The entanglement spectrum of the state has a clear entanglement gap which seems to remain finite in the thermodynamic limit. The levels below the gap exhibit counting identical to that of Laughlin 1/3 quasiholes. Both the 3 ground states and excited states exhibit spectral flow upon flux insertion. All the properties above disappear in the trivial state of the insulator - both the many-body energy gap and the entanglement gap close at the phase transition when the single-particle Hamiltonian goes from topologically nontrivial to topologically trivial. These facts clearly show that fractional many-body states are possible in topological insulators.},

abstract = {Detecting topological order in cold-atom experiments is an ongoing challenge, the resolution of which offers novel perspectives on topological matter. In material systems, unambiguous signatures of topological order exist for topological insulators and quantum Hall devices. In quantum Hall systems, the quantized conductivity and the associated robust propagating edge modes--guaranteed by the existence of nontrivial topological invariants--have been observed through transport and spectroscopy measurements. Here, we show that optical-lattice-based experiments can be tailored to directly visualize the propagation of topological edge modes. Our method is rooted in the unique capability for initially shaping the atomic gas and imaging its time evolution after suddenly removing the shaping potentials. Our scheme, applicable to an assortment of atomic topological phases, provides a method for imaging the dynamics of topological edge modes, directly revealing their angular velocity and spin structure.},

To fully explore the fundamental science and application of topological insulators, material realization is indispensable. Here we predict, based on tight-binding modelling and first-principles calculations, that bilayers of perovskite-type transition-metal oxides grown along the [111] crystallographic axis are potential candidates for two-dimensional topological insulators. The topological band structure of these materials can be fine-tuned by changing dopant ions, substrates and external gate voltages. We predict that LaAuO(3) bilayers have a topologically non-trivial energy gap of about 0.15 eV, which is sufficiently large to realize the quantum spin Hall effect at room temperature. Intriguing phenomena, such as fractional quantum Hall effect, associated with the nearly flat topologically non-trivial bands found in e(g) systems are also discussed.},

abstract = {Recently, generalizations of fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states known as fractional quantum anomalous Hall or, equivalently, fractional Chern insulators states have been realized in lattice models. Ideal wavefunctions such as the Laughlin wavefunction, as well as the corresponding trial Hamiltonians for which the former are exact ground states, have been vital to characterizing FQH phases. The Wannier function representation of fractional Chern insulators proposed in [X.-L. Qi, Phys. Rev. Lett., 126803] defines an approach to generalize these concepts to fractional Chern insulators. In this paper, we apply the Wannier function representation to develop a systematic pseudopotential formalism for fractional Chern insulators. The family of pseudopotential Hamiltonians is defined as the set of projectors onto asymptotic relative angular momentum components which forms an orthogonal basis of two-body Hamiltonians with magnetic translation symmetry. This approach serves both as an expansion tool for interactions and as a definition of positive semidefinite Hamiltonians for which the ideal fractional Chern insulator wavefunctions are exact nullspace modes. We compare the short-range two-body pseudopotential expansion of various fractional Chern insulator models at one-third filling in phase regimes where a Laughlin-type ground state is expected to be realized. We also discuss the effect of inhomogeneous Berry curvature which leads to components of the Hamiltonian that cannot be expanded into pseudopotentials, and elaborate on their role in determining low energy theories for fractional Chern insulators. Finally, we generalize our Chern pseudopotential approach to interactions involving more than two bodies with the goal of facilitating the identification of non-Abelian fractional Chern insulators.},

The non-interacting part of our Hamiltonian is the recently proposed topologically non-trivial flat-band model on a checkerboard lattice. In the presence of nearest-neighbouring repulsion, we find that at 1/3 filling, the Fermi-liquid state is unstable towards the fractional quantum Hall effect. At 1/5 filling, however, a next-nearest-neighbouring repulsion is needed for the occurrence of the 1/5 fractional quantum Hall effect when nearest-neighbouring repulsion is not too strong.

abstract = {We investigate the topological properties of the tight-binding electrons on the two-dimensional kagom\'{e} lattice with two kinds of short-range hopping integral and two kinds of staggered magnetic flux. Considering the nearest-neighbor hopping (t(1)) with the staggered flux parameter $\phi$(1) and the next nearest-neighbor hopping (t(2)) with the staggered flux parameter $\phi$(2), we demonstrate a series of topological quantum phase transitions and find some topological bands with high Chern numbers, when tuning one parameter (t(2) or $\phi$(2)) while the others are fixed. We have also found that, in some parameter regions, the system exhibits interesting topological flat bands with Chern number C =± 1 and a large gap above them, and the flatness ratio can reach a high value of about 170.},
